# Python Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python programming exercises and assignments completed as part of my coursework. The projects focus on building foundational skills in Python programming, including:

- Mathematical operations
- Control flow (if statements, loops)
- Function development
- Basic problem-solving algorithms

Each `.py` file represents a small standalone project or assignment.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Writing clean and structured Python code
- Translating flowcharts and algorithms into working programs
- Implementing functions, loops, and conditional logic
- Practicing modular code organization and basic debugging

## Folder Structure

- Individual `.py` files for each project or exercise
- (Optional) `/diagrams/` folder containing related flowcharts and planning documents

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate into the project folder.
4. Run any Python file using:

```bash
python filename.py
